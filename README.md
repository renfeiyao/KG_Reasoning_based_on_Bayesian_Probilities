# KG_Reasoning_based_on_Bayesian_Probilities
## General info
This repository exixts to store some of the work I've done on knowledge reasoning. The aim of the experiment is to predict upcoming dangers in the construction process of shield tunneling based on a series of risk factors. The data is extracted from pulished papers on shield tunneling and stored in a knowledge graph with nodes of 15 types based on a priori knoweldge (The extraction process was done in a previous project by someone else and therefore the result of the extraction will not be put here). The knwoledge graph is then transformed into a bayesian network with a predetermined structure [1]. By training the BN and predicting the probaility of a link between node representing risk factors and node representing potential danger, it is possile to predict the danger and, likewise, the corresponding solution to a specific construction project. The result showed a 80% precision on predicting risks and 50% on solutions (after adjusting the method to predicting the link between risk and solution). However, there are a few major drawbacks in this method, mainly in that the training of the BN is very costly and it adapts poorly to new data or any changes in the types of inputting nodes.
